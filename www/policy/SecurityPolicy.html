<h2 id="g0.1">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3 id="g0.1.1">Motivation and Scope </h3>
<p>
This Security Policy sets out the policy
for the secure operation of the CAcert critical computer systems.
These systems include:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
     Physical hardware mounting the logical services
   </li>
<li>
     Webserver + database (core server(s))
   </li>
<li>
     Signing service (signing server)
   </li>
<li>
     Source code (changes and patches)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The Committee of CAcert, Inc. (hereafter, "Board")
may add additional components into the Security Manual.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.1.1.1">Covered Personnel </h4>

<p>
Critical roles are covered.
These roles are defined as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
      Access Engineer
    </li>
<li>
      Systems Administrator
    </li>
<li>
      Support Engineer
    </li>
<li>
      Software Assessor
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="g0.1.1.2">Out of Scope </h4>

<p>
Non-critical systems are not covered by this manual,
but may be guided by it, and impacted where they are
found within the security context.
Architecture is out of scope, see CPS#6.2.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.1.2">Principles </h3>
<p>
Important principles of this Security Policy are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
      <i>dual control</i> -- at least two individuals must control a task
    </li>
<li>
      <i>four eyes</i> -- at least two individuals must participate in a task,
      one to execute and one to observe.
    </li>
<li>
      <i>redundancy</i> -- no single individual is the only one authorized
      to perform a task.
    </li>
<li>
      <i>escrow</i> -- where critical information (backups, passphrases)
      is kept with other parties
    </li>
<li>
      <i>logging</i> -- where events are recorded in a file
    </li>
<li>
      <i>separation of concerns</i> -- when a core task is split between
      two people from different areas
    </li>
<li>
      <i>Audit</i> -- where external reviewers do checks on practices and policies
    </li>
<li>
      <i>Authority</i> -- every action is authorised by either a policy or by the Arbitrator.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each task or asset is covered by a variety of protections
deriving from the above principles.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.1.3">Definition of Terms</h3>

    including maintenance, access control and physical security.
    See §1.1.
</dd>

<dt><i>Software Assessor</i> </dt>
<dd>
    A Member who reviews patches for security and workability,
    signs-off on them, and incorporates them into the repository.
    See §7.2.
</dd>

<dt><i>Support Engineer</i> </dt>

    A Member who manages a critical system, and has access
    to security-sensitive functions or data.
</dd>

</dl>

<h3 id="g0.1.4">Documents and Version control</h3>

<h4 id="g0.1.4.1">The Security Policy Document </h4>
<p>
This Security Policy is part of the Configuration-Control Specification
for audit purposes (DRC-A.1).
It is under the control of Policy on Policy for version purposes.
</p>

<p>
This policy document says what is done, rather than how to do it.
<b>Some sections are empty, which means "refer to the Manual."</b>
</p>

<h4 id="g0.1.4.2">The Security Manual (Practices) Document </h4>

<p>
This Policy explicitly defers detailed security practices to the
<a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/SecurityManual">Security Manual</a>
("SM").
The SM says how things are done.
As practices are things that vary from time to time,
including between each event of practice,
the SM is under the direct control of the
applicable team leaders.
It is located and version-controlled on the CAcert wiki.
</p>

<p>
Section Headings are the same in both documents.
Where Sections are empty in one document,
they are expected to be documented in the other.
"Document further in Security Manual" can be implied from
any section heading in the Policy.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.1.4.3">The Security Procedures </h4>

<p>
The team leaders may from time to time
explicitly defer single, cohesive components of the
security practices into separate procedures documents.
Each procedure should be managed in a wiki page under
their control, probably at
<a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/SystemAdministration/Procedures">
SystemAdministration/Procedures</a>.
Each procedure must be referenced explicitly in the Security Manual.
</p>

<h2 id="g0.2">PHYSICAL SECURITY</h2>

<h3 id="g0.2.1">Facility </h3>

<p>
CAcert shall host critical servers in a highly secure facility.
There shall be independent verification of the physical and
access security.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.2.2">Physical Assets </h3>

<h4 id="g0.2.2.1">Computers </h4>
<p>
Computers shall be inventoried before being put into service.
Inventory list shall be available to all
Access Engineers and all Systems Administrators.
List must be subject to change control.
</p>

<p>
Each unit shall be distinctly and uniquely identified on all visible sides.
Machines shall be housed in secured facilities (cages and/or locked racks).
</p>

<h4 id="g0.2.2.2">Acquisition </h4>
<p>
Equipment for critical purposes should be acquired
in a way to minimise pre-acquisition security risks.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.2.2.3">Service </h4>

<p>
Equipment that is subject to a service security risk
must be retired if service is required.
See also §2.2.3.3.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.2.2.4">Media </h4>

<h4 id="g0.2.2.5">Provisioning </h4>

<p>
Storage media (disk drives, tapes, removable media)
are inventoried upon acquisition and tracked in their use.
</p>

<p>
New storage media (whether disk or removable) shall be
securely erased and reformatted before use.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.2.2.6">Storage </h4>

<p>
Removable media shall be securely stored at all times,
including when not in use.
Drives that are kept for reuse are
erased securely before storage.
Reuse can only be within critical systems.
</p>

<p>
When there is a change to status of media,
a report is made to the log specifying the new status.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.2.2.7">Retirement </h4>

<p>
Storage media that is exposed to critical data and is
to be retired from service shall be destroyed or otherwise secured.
The following steps are to be taken:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
    The media is securely destroyed, <b>or</b>
  </li>
<li>
    the media is securely erased,
    and stored securely.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Records of secure erasure and method of final disposal
shall be tracked in the asset inventory.
Where critical data is involved,
two Systems Administrators must sign-off on each step.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.2.3">Physical Access </h3>

<p>
In accordance with the principle of dual control,
at least two persons authorized for access must
be on-site at the same time for physical access to be granted.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.2.3.1">Access Authorisation </h4>

<p>
Access to physical equipment must be authorised.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.2.3.2">Access Profiles </h4>

<p>
The Security Manual must present the different access profiles.
At least one Access Engineer must control access in all cases.
At least one Systems Administrator will be present for
logical access.
Only the most basic and safest of accesses should be done with
one Systems Administrator present.
</p>

<p>
There is no inherent authorisation to access the data.
Systems Administrators
are authorised to access
the raw data under the control of this policy.
All others must not access the raw data.
All are responsible for protecting the data
from access by those not authorised.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.2.3.3">Access Logging </h4>

<p>
All physical accesses are logged and reported to all.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.2.3.4">Emergency Access </h4>

<p>
There must not be a procedure for emergency access.
If, in the judgement of the Systems Administrator,
emergency access is required and gained,
in order to avoid a greater harm,
independent authorisation before the
Arbitrator must be sought as soon as possible.
See DRP.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.2.3.5">Physical Security codes &amp; devices </h4>

<p>
All personel who are in possession of physical security
codes and devices (keys) are to be authorised and documented.
</p>


<h2 id="g0.3">LOGICAL SECURITY</h2>

<h3 id="g0.3.1">Network </h3>
<h4 id="g0.3.1.1">Infrastructure </h4>

<p>
Current and complete diagrams of the physical and logical
CAcert network infrastructure shall be maintained by
Systems Administration team leader.
These diagrams should include cabling information,
physical port configuration details,
expected/allowed data flow directions,
and any further pertinent information,
as applicable.
Diagrams should be revision controlled,
and must be updated when any change is made.
</p>

<h5 id="g0.3.1.1.1">External connectivity </h5>

<p>
Only such services as are required for normal operation
should be visible externally;
systems and servers which do not require access
to the Internet for their normal operation
must not be granted that access.
If such access becomes temporarily necessary for an
authorized administrative task,
such access may be granted under the procedures of the SM
and must be reported and logged.
</p>

<h5 id="g0.3.1.1.2">Internal connectivity </h5>

<p>
System and server connections internal to the CAcert infrastructure
should be kept to the minimum required for routine operations. Any new
connectivity desired must be requested and approved by System
administration team leader and then must be reflected in the appropriate
 infrastructure diagram(s).
</p>


<h4 id="g0.3.1.2">Operating Configuration </h4>

<h5 id="g0.3.1.2.1">Ingress </h5>

<p>
All ports on which incoming traffic is expected shall be documented;
traffic to other ports must be blocked. Unexpected traffic must be
logged as an exception.
</p>

<h5 id="g0.3.1.2.2">Egress </h5>

<p>
All outbound traffic that is initiated shall be documented; traffic to
other destinations must be blocked. Unexpected traffic must be logged as
 an exception.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.3.1.3">Intrusion detection </h4>

<p>
Logs should be examined regularly (by manual or automatic means) for
unusual patterns and/or traffic; anomalies should be investigated as
they are discovered and should be reported to appropriate personnel in
near-real-time (e.g. text message, email) and investigated as soon as
possible. Suspicious activity which may indicate an actual system
intrusion or compromise should trigger the incident response protocol
described in section 5.1.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.3.2">Operating System </h3>

<p>
Any operating system used for critical server machines must be available under an OSI-approved open source software license.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.3.2.1">Disk Encryption </h4>

<p>
Any operating system used for critical server machines must support
software full-disk or disk volume encryption, and this encryption option
 must be enabled for all relevant disks/volumes when the operating
system is first installed on the machine.
</p>


<h4 id="g0.3.2.2">Operating configuration </h4>

<p>
Servers must enable only the operating system functions required to
support the necessary services. Options and packages chosen at OS
install shall be documented, and newly-installed systems must be
inspected to ensure that only required services are active, and their
functionality is limited through configuration options. Any required
application software must follow similar techniques to ensure minimal
exposure footprint.
</p>

<p>
Documentation for installing and configuring servers with the
appropriate software packages and configurations will be maintained by
the System Administrators.
</p>


<h4 id="g0.3.2.3">Patching </h4>

<p>
Software used on production servers must be kept current with respect to
 patches affecting software security. Patch application
must be approved by the Systems Administration team leader, fully
documented in the logs and reported by email to the Systems
Administration list on completion (see §4.2).
</p>

<h5 id="g0.3.2.3.1">“emergency” patching </h5>

<p>
Application of a patch is deemed an <i>emergency</i>
when a remote exploit for a weakness in the particular piece
of software has become known
(on servers allowing direct local user access,
an emergent local exploit may also be deemed to be an emergency).
Application of patches in this case may occur as soon as possible,
bypassing the normal configuration-change process.
The Systems Administration team leader must either approve the patch
or instruct remedial action, and refer the case to dispute resolution.
</p>

<p>
<b> <!-- this comment left in bold deliberately -->
Declaration of an emergency patching situation should not occur with any regularity.
</b>
Emergency patch events must be documented
within the regular summaries
by the team leader to Board
independent of filed disputes.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.3.3">Application </h3>

<p>
Requests for ad hoc queries over the application database for business
or similar purposes must be approved by the Arbitrator.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.3.4">Access control </h3>

<p>
All access to critical data and services shall be
controlled and logged.

Access to the special features is under tight control.
Additions to the team are subject to Board approval,
and the software features are under CCS.
See §3.4.2.
</p>

<p>
Support Engineers do not have any inherent authority
to take any action,
and they have to get authority on a case-by-case basis.
The authority required in each case must be guided
by this policy or the Security Manual or other clearly
applicable document.
If the Member's authority is not in doubt,
the Member can give that authority.
If not, the Arbitrator's authority must be sought.
</p>

<p>
Support Engineers are responsible to follow the

<h3 id="g0.9.5">Confidentiality, Secrecy </h3>

<p>
CAcert is an open organisation and adopts a principle
of open disclosure wherever possible.
See <a href="https://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/principles.html">
Principles</a>.
This is not a statement of politics but a statement of security;
if a security issue can only be sustained
under some confidentiality or secrecy, then find another way.
</p>

<p>
In concrete terms,
confidentiality or secrecy may be maintained only
under a defined method in policy,
or under the oversight of the Arbitrator
(which itself is under DRP).
The exception itself must not be secret or confidential.
All secrets and confidentials are reviewable under Arbitration,
and may be reversed.
All should strive to reduce or remove any such
restriction.
