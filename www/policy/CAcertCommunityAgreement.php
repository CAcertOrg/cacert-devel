  <h2>CAcert Community Agreement</h2>

  CAcert's community at large ("Community") and CAcert Incorporated ("CAcert"),
  being an operator of services to the Community.</p>

    and generally includes corporations and other entities that become Members
    and become Assured.</li>

    <li>"Community" means all of the Members that are registered by this
    agreement and other parties by other agreements, all being under CAcert's

  </ol>

  <h4><a name="2.3">2.3</a> Obligations</h4>

  <p>You are obliged</p>

    permission for verification of the information using CAcert-approved
    methods.</li>

    <li>to make no false representations.</li>

    <li>to submit all your disputes to Arbitration (DRP =&gt; COD7).</li>

    <li>to not share your CAcert account.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="2.4">2.4</a> Principles</h4>

  <p>As a Member of CAcert, you are a member of the Community. You are further
  obliged to work within the spirit of the Principles of the Community. These
  are described in <a href=
  "https://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/principles.html">Principles of the
  Community</a>.</p>

  <h4><a name="2.5">2.5</a> Security</h4>

  <p>CAcert exists to help you to secure yourself. You are primarily
  responsible for your own security. Your security obligations include</p>

  <ol>
    <li>to secure yourself and your computing platform (e. g. PC),</li>

    <li>to keep your email account in good working order,</li>

    <li>to secure your CAcert account (e. g., credentials such as username,
    password),</li>

    <li>to secure your private keys, ensuring that they are only used as
    indicated by the certificate, or by wider agreement with others,</li>

    <li>to review certificates for accuracy, and</li>

    <li>when in doubt, notify CAcert,</li>

    <li>when in doubt, take other reasonable actions, such as revoking
    certificates, changing account credentials, and/or generating new
    keys.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Where, above, 'secure' means to protect to a reasonable degree, in
  proportion with your risks and the risks of others.</p>

  <h3><a name="3">3.</a> Law and Jurisdiction</h3>

  <h4><a name="3.1">3.1</a> Governing Law</h4>

  <p>This agreement is governed under the law of New South Wales, Australia,
  being the home of the CAcert Inc. Association.</p>

  <h4><a name="3.2">3.2</a> Arbitration as Forum of Dispute Resolution</h4>

  <p>You agree, with CAcert and all of the Community, that all disputes arising
  out of or in connection to our use of CAcert services shall be referred to
  and finally resolved by Arbitration under the rules within the Dispute
  Resolution Policy of CAcert (DRP =&gt; COD7). The rules select a single
  Arbitrator chosen by CAcert from among senior Members in the Community. The
  ruling of the Arbitrator is binding and final on Members and CAcert
  alike.</p>

  <p>In general, the jurisdiction for resolution of disputes is within CAcert's
  own forum of Arbitration, as defined and controlled by its own rules (DRP
  =&gt; COD7).</p>

  <p>We use Arbitration for many purposes beyond the strict nature of disputes,
  such as governance and oversight. A systems administrator may need
  authorisation to conduct a non-routine action, and Arbitration may provide
  that authorisation. Thus, you may find yourself party to Arbitration that is
  simply support actions, and you may file disputes in order to initiate
  support actions.</p>

  <h4><a name="3.3">3.3</a> Termination</h4>

  <p>The CAcert Community Agreement is terminated</p>

  <ol>
    <li>based on a Policy Group decision following (PoP =&gt; COD1). This
    terminates the Agreement with every member.</li>

    <li>with a ruling of the Arbitrator or the completion of a termination
    process defined by an Arbitrator ruling (DRP =&gt; COD7).</li>

    <li>by the end of existence of a member (i.e. death in the case of
    individuals).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>A member may declare the wish to resign from CAcert at any time by writing
  to <em>support AT cacert.org</em>. This triggers a process for termination of
  this agreement with the member.</p>

  <h4><a name="3.3">3.3a</a> Consequences of Termination</h4>

  <p>The termination discontinues the right to USE, OFFER and CREATE personal
  certificates in any account of the former member. Those certificates will be
  revoked and all services to the former member will be terminated as soon as
  possible. However, some information will continue to be held for certificate
  processing purposes.</p>

  <p>The provisions on Arbitration for the time of membership survive any
  termination. Former members are still bound by the DRP (COD7), and the
  Arbitrator may reinstate any provision of this agreement or bind them to a
  ruling.</p>

  <p>As far as Organisations are concerned details are also defined in the
  Organisation Assurance Policy (OAP =&gt; COD11).</p>

  <p>Every member learning about the death of a member or termination of
  existence of a member should notify <em>support AT cacert.org</em>.</p>

  <h4><a name="3.4">3.4</a> Changes of Agreement</h4>

  <p>CAcert may from time to time vary the terms of this Agreement. Changes
  will be done according to the documented CAcert policy for changing policies,
  and is subject to scrutiny and feedback by the Community. Changes will be
  notified to you by email to your primary address.</p>

  <p>If you do not agree to the changes, you may terminate as above. Continued
  use of the service shall be deemed to be agreement by you.</p>

  <h4><a name="3.5">3.5</a> Communication</h4>

  <p>You are responsible for keeping your primary email account in good working
  order and able to receive emails from CAcert.</p>

  <p>Notifications to CAcert are to be sent by email to the address <em>support
  AT cacert.org</em>. You should attach a digital signature.</p>

  <h3><a name="4">4.</a> Miscellaneous</h3>

  <h4><a name="4.1">4.1</a> (withdrawn)</h4>

  <h4><a name="4.2">4.2</a> References and Other Binding Documents</h4>

  <p>You are also bound by the Policies of the Community under the control of
  Policy on Policy ("PoP" =&gt; COD1) and listed in <a href=
  "https://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/Policies/ControlledDocumentList.html">Controlled
  Document List</a>.</p>

  <p>Controlled documents are primary, and may not be replaced or waived except
  by formal policy channels and Arbitration.</p>

  <p>This agreement is controlled document COD9.</p>

  <h4><a name="4.3">4.3</a> Informative References</h4>

  <p>The governing documents are in English. Documents may be translated for
  convenience. Because we cannot control the legal effect of translations, the
  English documents are the ruling ones.</p>

  <p>Beside this Agreement and the Policies, there are other documents, i. e.
  Policy Guides, Manuals and Handbooks, supporting and explaining this
  Agreement and the Policies. These documents are not binding and in doubt this
  Agreement and the Policies are valid.</p>
