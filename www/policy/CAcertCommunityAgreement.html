<h4 id="s3.1"> 3.1   Governing Law </h4>

<p>
This agreement is governed under the law of

being the home of the CAcert Inc. Association.
</p>

<h4 id="s3.2"> 3.2   Arbitration as Forum of Dispute Resolution </h4>

<p>
You agree, with CAcert and all of the Community,
that all disputes arising out
of or in connection to our use of CAcert services
shall be referred to and finally resolved
by Arbitration under the rules within the
Dispute Resolution Policy of CAcert
(DRP =&gt; COD7).
The rules select a single Arbitrator chosen by CAcert
from among senior Members in the Community.
The ruling of the Arbitrator is binding and
final on Members and CAcert alike.
</p>

<p>
In general, the jurisdiction for resolution of disputes
is within CAcert's own forum of Arbitration,
as defined and controlled by its own rules (DRP =&gt; COD7).
</p>

<p>
We use Arbitration for many purposes beyond the strict
nature of disputes, such as governance and oversight.
A systems administrator may
need authorisation to conduct a non-routine action,
and Arbitration may provide that authorisation.
Thus, you may find yourself party to Arbitration
that is simply support actions, and you may file disputes in
order to initiate support actions.
</p>

<h4 id="s3.3"> 3.3   Termination </h4>
<p>
You may terminate this agreement by resigning
from CAcert.  You may do this at any time by
writing to CAcert's online support forum and
filing dispute to resign.
All services will be terminated, and your
certificates will be revoked.
However, some information will continue to
be held for certificate processing purposes.
</p>

<p>
The provisions on Arbitration survive any termination
by you by leaving CAcert.
That is, even if you resign from CAcert,
you are still bound by the DRP (COD7),
and the Arbitrator may reinstate any provision of this
agreement or bind you to a ruling.
</p>

<p>
Only the Arbitrator may terminate this agreement with you.
</p>

<h4 id="s3.4"> 3.4   Changes of Agreement </h4>

<p>
CAcert may from time to time vary the terms of this Agreement.
Changes will be done according to the documented CAcert policy
for changing policies, and is subject to scrutiny and feedback
by the Community.
Changes will be notified to you by email to your primary address.
</p>

<p>
If you do not agree to the changes, you may terminate as above.
Continued use of the service shall be deemed to be agreement
by you.
</p>

<h4 id="s3.5"> 3.5   Communication </h4>

<p>
Notifications to CAcert are to be sent by
email to the address
<b>support</b> <i>at</i> CAcert.org.
You should attach a digital signature,
but need not do so in the event of security
or similar urgency.
</p>

<p>
Notifications to you are sent
by CAcert to the primary email address
registered with your account.
You are responsible for keeping your email
account in good working order and able
to receive emails from CAcert.
