  <h2>CAcert Community Agreement</h2>

  <h3><a name="0">0.</a> Introduction</h3>

  <p>This agreement is between you, being a registered member ("Member") within
  CAcert's community at large ("Community") and CAcert Incorporated ("CAcert"),
  being an operator of services to the Community.</p>

  <h4><a name="0.1">0.1</a> Terms</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>"CAcert" means CAcert Inc., a non-profit Association of Members
    incorporated in New South Wales, Australia. Note that Association Members
    are distinct from the Members defined here.</li>

    <li>"Member" means you, a registered participant within CAcert's Community,
    with an account on the website and the facility to request certificates.
    Members may be individuals ("natural persons") or organisations ("legal
    persons").</li>

    <li>"Organisation" is defined under the Organisation Assurance programme,
    and generally includes corporations and other entities that become Members
    and become Assured.</li>

    <li>"Community" means all of the Members that are registered by this
    agreement and other parties by other agreements, all being under CAcert's
    Arbitration.</li>

    <li>"Non-Related Person" ("NRP"), being someone who is not a Member, is not
    part of the Community, and has not registered their agreement. <span class=
    "strike7">Such people are offered the NRP-DaL another agreement allowing
    the USE of certificates.</span></li>

    <li><span class="strike7">"Non-Related Persons - Disclaimer and Licence"
    ("NRP-DaL"), another agreement that is offered to persons outside the
    Community.</span><span class="change7">(withdrawn)</span></li>

    <li>"Arbitration" is the Community's forum for resolving disputes, or

    basis of the claim(s) bound within a certificate.</li>

    <li>"OFFER" means the your act of making available your certificate to

    as your agent and facilite this and other tasks. OFFER does not imply
    suggestion of reliance.</li>

    <li>"Issue" means creation of a certificate by CAcert. To create a
    certificate, CAcert affixes a digital signature from the root onto a public
    key and other information. This act would generally bind a statement or
    claim, such as your name, to your key.</li>

    <li>"Root" means CAcert's top level key, used for signing certificates for
    Members. In this document, the term includes any subroots.</li>

    details of operation and governance essential to a certificate authority.

  </ol>

  <p>Where, above, 'secure' means to protect to a reasonable degree, in
  proportion with your risks and the risks of others.</p>

  <h3><a name="3">3.</a> Law and Jurisdiction</h3>

  <h4><a name="3.1">3.1</a> Governing Law</h4>

  <p>This agreement is governed under the law of New South Wales, Australia,
  being the home of the CAcert Inc. Association.</p>

  <h4><a name="3.2">3.2</a> Arbitration as Forum of Dispute Resolution</h4>

  <p>You agree, with CAcert and all of the Community, that all disputes arising
  out of or in connection to our use of CAcert services shall be referred to
  and finally resolved by Arbitration under the rules within the Dispute
  Resolution Policy of CAcert (DRP =&gt; COD7). The rules select a single
  Arbitrator chosen by CAcert from among senior Members in the Community. The
  ruling of the Arbitrator is binding and final on Members and CAcert
  alike.</p>

  <p>In general, the jurisdiction for resolution of disputes is within CAcert's
  own forum of Arbitration, as defined and controlled by its own rules (DRP
  =&gt; COD7).</p>

  <p>We use Arbitration for many purposes beyond the strict nature of disputes,
  such as governance and oversight. A systems administrator may need
  authorisation to conduct a non-routine action, and Arbitration may provide
  that authorisation. Thus, you may find yourself party to Arbitration that is
  simply support actions, and you may file disputes in order to initiate
  support actions.</p>

  <h4><a name="3.3">3.3</a> Termination</h4>

  <p><span class="strike12">You may terminate this agreement by resigning from
  CAcert. You may do this at any time by writing to CAcert's online support
  forum and filing dispute to resign. All services will be terminated, and your
  certificates will be revoked. However, some information will continue to be
  held for certificate processing purposes.</span></p>

  <p><span class="strike12">The provisions on Arbitration survive any
  termination by you by leaving CAcert. That is, even if you resign from
  CAcert, you are still bound by the DRP (COD7), and the Arbitrator may
  reinstate any provision of this agreement or bind you to a ruling.</span></p>

  <p><span class="strike12">Only the Arbitrator may terminate this agreement
  with you.</span></p>

  <p><span class="change12">The CAcert Community Agreement is
  terminated</span></p>

  <ol>
    <li><span class="change12">based on a Policy Group decision following (PoP
    =&gt; COD1). This terminates the Agreement with every member.</span></li>

    <li><span class="change12">with a ruling of the Arbitrator or the
    completion of a termination process defined by an Arbitrator ruling (DRP
    =&gt; COD7).</span></li>

    <li><span class="change12">by the end of existence of a member (i.e. death
    in the case of individuals).</span></li>
  </ol>

  <p><span class="change12">A member may declare the wish to resign from CAcert
  at any time by writing to <em>support AT cacert.org</em>. This triggers a
  process for termination of this agreement with the member.</span></p>

  <h4><span class="change12"><a name="3.3">3.3a</a> Consequences of
  Termination</span></h4>

  <p><span class="change12">The termination discontinues the right to USE,
  OFFER and CREATE personal certificates in any account of the former member.
  Those certificates will be revoked and all services to the former member will
  be terminated as soon as possible. However, some information will continue to
  be held for certificate processing purposes.</span></p>

  <p><span class="change12">The provisions on Arbitration for the time of
  membership survive any termination. Former members are still bound by the DRP
  (COD7), and the Arbitrator may reinstate any provision of this agreement or
  bind them to a ruling.</span></p>

  <p><span class="change12">As far as Organisations are concerned details are
  also defined in the Organisation Assurance Policy (OAP =&gt;
  COD11).</span></p>

  <p><span class="change12">Every member learning about the death of a member
  or termination of existence of a member should notify <em>support AT
  cacert.org</em>.</span></p>

  <h4><a name="3.4">3.4</a> Changes of Agreement</h4>

  <p>CAcert may from time to time vary the terms of this Agreement. Changes
  will be done according to the documented CAcert policy for changing policies,
  and is subject to scrutiny and feedback by the Community. Changes will be
  notified to you by email to your primary address.</p>

  <p>If you do not agree to the changes, you may terminate as above. Continued
  use of the service shall be deemed to be agreement by you.</p>

  <h4><a name="3.5">3.5</a> Communication</h4>

  <p><span class="change6">You are responsible for keeping your primary email
  account in good working order and able to receive emails from
  CAcert.</span></p>

  <p>Notifications to CAcert are to be sent by email to the address <em>support
  AT cacert.org</em>. You should attach a digital signature<span class=
  "strike6">, but need not do so in the event of security or similar
  urgency</span>.</p>

  <p><span class="strike6">Notifications to you are sent by CAcert to the
  primary email address registered with your account. You are responsible for
  keeping your email account in good working order and able to receive emails
  from CAcert.</span></p>

  <p><span class="strike6">Arbitration is generally conducted by
  email.</span></p>

  Community</span> <span class="change10">(withdrawn)</span></h4>
