<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>

<section id="p1.1">
<h3>1.1. Overview</h3>

<p>
This document is the Certification Practice Statement (CPS) of
CAcert, the Community Certification Authority (CA).
It describes rules and procedures used by CAcert for
operating its CA,
and applies to all CAcert PKI Participants,
including Assurers, Members, and CAcert itself.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p1.2">
<h3>1.2. Document name and identification</h3>

<p>
This document is the Certification Practice Statement (CPS) of CAcert.
The CPS also fulfills the role of the Certificate Policy (CP)
for each class of certificate.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    This document is COD6 under CAcert Official Documents numbering scheme.
  </li>
  <li>
    The document is structured according to
    Chokhani, et al,
    <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3647.txt">RFC3647</a>,
    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3647#section-4">chapter 4</a>.
    All headings derive from that Chapter.
  </li>
  <li>
    It has been improved and reviewed (or will be reviewed)
    to meet or exceed the criteria of the
    <cite>Certificate Authority Review Checklist</cite>
    from <em>David E. Ross</em> ("DRC")
    and Mozilla Foundation's CA policy.
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    Earlier notes were written by Christian Barmala
    in a document placed under GNU Free Document License
    and under FSF copyright.
    However this clashed with the control provisions of
    Configuration-Control Specification
    (COD2) within Audit criteria.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The CPS is an authoritive document,
and rules other documents
except where explicitly deferred to.

<section id="p1.3">
<h3>1.3. PKI participants</h3>

<p>
The CA is legally operated by CAcert Incorporated,
an Association registered in 2002 in
New South Wales, Australia,
on behalf of the wider Community of Members of CAcert.
The Association details are at the
<a href="https://wiki.cacert.org/CAcertInc">CAcert wiki</a>.
</p>

<p>
CAcert is a Community formed of Members who agree to the
CAcert Community Agreement (<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.html">COD9</a>).
The CA is technically operated by the Community,
under the direction of the Board of CAcert Incorporated.
(The Members of the Community are not to be confused
with the <em>Association Members</em>, which latter are
not referred to anywhere in this CPS.)
</p>

<section id="p1.3.1">
<h4>1.3.1. Certification authorities</h4>
<p>
CAcert does not issue certificates to external
intermediate CAs under the present CPS.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p1.3.2">
<h4>1.3.2. Registration authorities</h4>
<p>
Registration Authorities (RAs) are controlled under Assurance Policy
(<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/AssurancePolicy.html">COD13</a>).
</p>
</section>

<section id="p1.3.3">
<h4>1.3.3. Subscribers</h4>

<p>
CAcert issues certificates to Members only.
Such Members then become Subscribers.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p1.3.4">
<h4>1.3.4. Relying parties</h4>

<p>
A relying party is a Member,
having agreed to the
CAcert Community Agreement
(<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.html">COD9</a>),
who, in the act of using a CAcert certificate,
makes a decision on the basis of that certificate.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p1.3.5">
<h4>1.3.5. Other participants</h4>

<dl>

<dt>Member</dt>
<dd>Membership of the Community is as defined in the
<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.html">COD9</a>.
Only Members may RELY or may become Subscribers.
Membership is free.
</dd>

<dt>Arbitrator</dt>
<dd>A senior and experienced Member of the CAcert Community
who resolves disputes between Members, including ones
of certificate reliance, under
Dispute Resolution Policy
(<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/DisputeResolutionPolicy.html">COD7</a>).
</dd>

<dt>Vendor</dt>
<dd>Software suppliers who integrate the root certificates of CAcert
into their software also assume a proxy role of Relying Parties,
and are subject to another licence.
</dd>

<dt>Non-Related Persons (NRPs)</dt>
<dd>These are users of browsers and similar software who are
unaware of the CAcert certificates they may use, and
are unaware of the ramifications of usage.
Their relationship with CAcert
is described by the
Root Distribution License
(<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/RootDistributionLicense.html">COD14</a>).
No other rights nor relationship is implied or offered.
</dd>

<section id="p1.4">
<h3>1.4. Certificate usage</h3>

<p>CAcert serves as issuer of certificates for
individuals, businesses, governments, charities,
associations, churches, schools,
non-governmental organisations or other groups.
CAcert certificates are intended for low-cost
community applications especially where volunteers can
become Assurers and help CAcert to help the Community.
</p>

<p>
Types of certificates and their appropriate and
corresponding applications are defined in
<a href="#p1.4.1">&sect;1.4.1</a>.
Prohibited applications are defined in <a href="#p1.4.2">&sect;1.4.2</a>.
Specialist uses may be agreed by contract or within
a specific environment, as described in
<a href="#p1.4.4">&sect;1.4.4</a>.
Note also the
unreliable applications in
<a href="#p1.4.3">&sect;1.4.3</a>
and risks, liabilities and obligations in
<a href="#p9">&sect;9</a>.

</figure>


<section id="p1.4.1">
<h4>1.4.1. Appropriate certificate uses</h4>

<p>
General uses.
</p>

<ul><li>
    CAcert server certificates can be used to enable encryption
    protection in web servers.
    Suitable applications include webmail and chat forums.
  </li><li>
    CAcert server certificates can be used to enable encryption
    in SSL/TLS links in embedded protocols such as mail servers
    and IM-servers.
  </li><li>
    CAcert client certificates can be used to enable encryption
    protection in email clients.
    (See <a href="#p1.4.3">&sect;1.4.3</a> for caveat on signatures.)
  </li><li>
    CAcert client certificates can be used to replace password-based
    authentication to web servers.
  </li><li>
    OpenPGP keys with CAcert signatures can be used
    to encrypt and sign files and emails,
    using software compatible with OpenPGP.
  </li><li>
    CAcert client certificates can be used in web-based
    authentication applications.
  </li><li>
    CAcert code signing certificates can be used to sign code
    for distribution to other people.
  </li><li>
    Time stamping can be used to attach a time record
    to a digital document.
</li></ul>
</section>


<section id="p1.4.2">
<h4>1.4.2. Prohibited certificate uses</h4>
<p>
CAcert certificates are not designed, intended, or authorised for
the following applications:
</p>
<ul><li>
    Use or resale as control equipment in hazardous circumstances
    or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation
    of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems,
    air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems,
    where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury,
    or severe environmental damage.
</li></ul>
</section>

<section id="p1.4.3">
<h4>1.4.3. Unreliable Applications</h4>

<p>
CAcert certificates are not designed nor intended for use in
the following applications, and may not be reliable enough
for these applications:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Signing within Protocols</dt>
    <dd>
    Digital signatures made by CAcert certificates carry
    <span class="u">NO default legal or human meaning</span>.
    See <a href="#p9.15.1">&sect;9.15.1</a>.
    Especially, protocols such as S/MIME commonly will automatically
    apply digital signatures as part of their protocol needs.
    The purpose of the cryptographic signature in S/MIME
    and similar protocols is limited by default to strictly
    protocol security purposes:
    to provide some confirmation that a familiar certificate
    is in use, to enable encryption, and to ensure the integrity
    of the email in transit.
    </dd>

    <dt>Non-repudiation applications</dt>
    <dd>
    Non-repudiation is not to be implied from use of
    CAcert certificates.  Rather, certificates may
    provide support or evidence of actions, but that
    evidence is testable in any dispute.
    </dd>

    <dt>Ecommerce applications</dt>
    <dd>
    Financial transactions or payments or valuable e-commerce.
    </dd>

	<dt>Identity verification</dt>
    <dd>
    Use of anonymous (Class 1 or Member SubRoot) certificates
    in any application that requires or expects identity.
    </dd>
</dl>
</section>


<section id="p1.4.4">
<h4>1.4.4. Limited certificate uses</h4>

<p>
By contract or within a specific environment
(e.g. internal to a company),
CAcert Members are permitted to use Certificates

<dl>
<dt>Named Certificates</dt>
<dd>
Assured Members may be issued certificates
with their verified names in the certificate.  In this role, CAcert
operates and supports a network of Assurers who verify the
identity of the Members.
All Names are verified, either by Assurance or another defined
method under policy (c.f. Organisations).
</dd>

<dt>Anonymous Certificates.</dt>
<dd>
Members can be issued certificates that are anonymous,
which is defined as the certificate with no Name included,
or a shared name such as "Community Member".
These may be considered to be somewhere between Named certificates
and self-signed certificates.  They have serial numbers in them
which is ultimately traceable via dispute to a Member, but
reliance is undefined.
In this role, CAcert provides the
infrastructure, saving the Members from managing a difficult
and messy process in order to get manufactured certificates.
</dd>

<dt>Psuedonymous Certificates</dt>
<dd>
Note that CAcert does not currently issue pseudonymous certificates,
being those with a name chosen by the Member and not verifiable
according to documents.
</dd>

<dt>Advanced Certificates</dt>
<dd>
Members who are as yet unassured are not permitted to create
advanced forms such as wildcard or subjectAltName
certificates.
</dd>

The CAcert root layout is as below.
These roots are pending Audit,
and will be submitted to vendors via the (Top-level) Root.

</p>

<p>
Under the Assurance Policy (<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/AssurancePolicy.html">COD13</a>),
there are means for Members to search, retrieve

  <li>The root certificate and intermediate certificates.</li>
</ul>

<p>
CAcert does not expressly publish information on issued certificates.

CAcert uses industry-standard techniques to
prove the possession of the private key.
</p>

<p>
For X.509 server certificates,
the stale digital signature of the CSR is verified.
For X.509 client certificates for "Netscape" browsers,
SPKAC uses a challenge-response protocol
to check the private key dynamically.
For X.509 client certificates for "explorer" browsers,
ActiveX uses a challenge-response protocol
to check the private key dynamically.

<h4>3.2.3. Authentication of organization identity</h4>

<p>
Verification of organisations is delegated by
the Assurance Policy to the
Organisation Assurance Policy
(<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/OrganisationAssurancePolicy.html">COD11</a>).
The reader is refered to the Organisation Assurance Policy,
the following is representative and brief only.
</p>

<p>
Organisations present special challenges.
The Assurance process for Organisations is
intended to permit the organisational Name to
appear in certificates.
The process relies heavily on the Individual
process described above.
</p>

<p>
Organisation Assurance achieves the standard
stated in the OAP, briefly presented here:
</p>
<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;"><li>
   the organisation exists,
  </li><li>
   the organisation name is correct and consistent,
  </li><li>
   signing rights: requestor can sign on behalf of the organisation, and
  </li><li>
   the organisation has agreed to the terms of the
   CAcert Community Agreement
   (<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.html">COD9</a>),
   and is therefore subject to Arbitration.

<h2>4. CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<p>
The general life-cycle for a new certificate for an Individual Member is:</p>
<ol><li>
    Member adds claim to an address (domain/email).
  </li><li>
    System probes address for control.
  </li><li>
    Member creates key pair.
  </li><li>
    Member submits CSR with desired options (Anonymous Certificate, SSO, Root Certificate) .
  </li><li>
    System validates and accepts CSR based on
    known information:  claims, assurance, controls, technicalities.
  </li><li>
    System signs certificate.
  </li><li>
    System makes signed certificate available to Member.
  </li><li>
    Member accepts certificate.
</li></ol>



<p>
(Some steps are not applicable, such as anonymous certificates.)
</p>


<section id="p4.1">
<h3>4.1. Certificate Application</h3>

<section id="p4.1.1">
<h4>4.1.1. Who can submit a certificate application</h4>

<p>
Members may submit certificate applications.
On issuance of certificates, Members become Subscribers.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p4.1.2">
<h4>4.1.2. Adding Addresses</h4>

<p>
The Member can claim ownership or authorised control of
a domain or email address on the online system.
This is a necessary step towards issuing a certificate.
There are these controls:</p>
<ul><li>
    The claim of ownership or control is legally significant
    and may be referred to dispute resolution.
  </li><li>
    Each unique address can be handled by one account only.
  </li><li>
    When the Member makes the claim,
    the certificate application system automatically initiates the
    check of control, as below.
</li></ul>
</section>


<section id="p4.1.3">
<h4>4.1.3. Preparing CSR </h4>

<p>
Members generate their own key-pairs.
The CAcert Community Agreement
(<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.html">COD9</a>)
obliges the Member as responsible for security.
See <a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.html#s2.5">CCA 2.5</a>, <a href="#p9.6">&sect;9.6</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is prepared by the
Member for presentation to the automated system.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p4.2">
<h3>4.2. Certificate application processing</h3>

<p>
The CA's certificate application process is completely automated.
Requests, approvals and rejections are handled by the website system.
Each application should be processed in less than a minute.
</p>
<p>
Where certificates are requested for more than one
purpose, the requirements for each purpose must be
fulfilled.
</p>

<section id="p4.2.1">
<h4>4.2.1. Authentication </h4>

<p>
  The Member logs in to her account on the CAcert website
      and thereby authenticates herself with username
      and passphrase or with her CAcert client-side digital certificate.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p4.2.2">
<h4>4.2.2. Verifying Control</h4>

<p>
In principle, at least two controls are placed on each address.
</p>

<dl>

<dt id="ping">Email-Ping</dt>
<dd>
Email addresses are verified by means of an
<em><a id="pingtest">Email-Ping test</a></em>:
<ul><li>
      The system generates a cookie
      (a random, hard-to-guess code)
      and formats it as a string.
  </li><li>
      The system sends the cookie
      to the Member in an email.
  </li><li>
      Once the Member receives the email,
      she enters the cookie into the website.
  </li><li>
      The entry of the code verifies
      control of that email account.
</li></ul>
</dd>

<dt id="email">Email Control</dt>
<dd>
Email addresses for client certificates are verified by passing the
following checks:
<ol>
  <li>An Email-ping test
      is done on the email address.
      </li>
  <li>The Member must have signed a CAP form or equivalent,
      and been awarded at least one Assurance point.
      </li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt id="domain">Domain Control</dt>
<dd>
Domains addresses for server certificates are verified by passing two of the
following checks:
<ol> <li>
      An Email-ping test
      is done on an email address chosen from <em>whois</em>
      or interpolated from the domain name.
  </li> <li>
      The system generates a cookie
      which is then placed in DNS
      by the Member.
  </li> <li>
      The system generates a cookie
      which is then placed in HTTP headers or a text file on the website
      by the Member.
  </li> <li>
      Statement by at least 2 Assurers about
      ownership/control of the domain name.
  </li> <li>
      The system generates a cookie
      which is then placed in whois registry information
      by the Member.
</li> </ol>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
Notes.</p>
<ul><li>
    Other methods can be added from time to time by CAcert.
  </li><li>
    Static cookies should remain for the duration of a certificate
    for occasional re-testing.
  </li><li>
    Dynamic tests can be repeated at a later time of CAcert's choosing.
  </li><li>
    Domain control checks may be extended to apply to email control
    in the future.
</li></ul>

<dt>Members may rely.</dt>
<dd>
Relying parties are Members,
and as such are bound by this CPS and the
CAcert Community Agreement
(<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.html">COD9</a>).
The licence and permission to rely is not assignable.
</dd>

<dt>Suppliers of Software</dt>
<dd>
CAcert roots may be distributed in software,
and those providers may
enter into agreement with CAcert by means of the
Third Party Vendor - Disclaimer and Licence
(wip).
This licence brings the supplier in to the Community
to the extent that
they agree to dispute resolution
within CAcert's forum.
</dd>

<dt>NRPs may not rely.</dt>
<dd>
If not related to CAcert by means of an agreement
that binds the parties to dispute resolution within CAcert's forum,
a person is a Non-Related-Person (NRP).
An NRP is not permitted to rely and is not a Relying Party.

<h5>4.5.2.c The Act of Reliance </h5>

<dl>

<dt>Decision making</dt>
<dd>
Reliance means taking a decision that is in part or in whole
based on the information in the certificate.

A Relying Party may incorporate
the information in the certificate,
and the implied information such as Membership,
into her decision-making.
In making a decision,
a Relying Party should also:
<ul><li>
    include her own overall risk equation,
  </li><li>
    include the general limitations of the Assurance process,
    certificates, and wider security considerations,
  </li><li>
    make additional checks to provide more information,
  </li><li>
    consider any wider agreement with the other Member, and
  </li><li>
    use an appropriate protocol or custom of reliance (below).
</li></ul>
</dd>

<dt>Examining the Certificate</dt>
<dd>
A Relying Party must make her own decision in using
each certificate.  She must examine the certificate,
a process called <em>validation</em>.
Certificate-related information includes,
but is not limited to:
<ul><li>
    Name,
  </li><li>
    expiry time of certificate,
  </li><li>
    current certificate revocation list (CRL),
  </li><li>
    certificate chain and
    the validity check of the certificates in the chain,
  </li><li>
    issuer of certificate (CAcert),
  </li><li>
    SubRoot is intended for reliance (Assured, Organisation and Class 3)
  </li><li>
    purpose of certificate.
</li></ul>
</dd>

<dt>Keeping Records</dt>
<dd>
Records should be kept, appropriate to the import of the decision.
The certificate should be preserved.
This should include sufficient
evidence to establish who the parties are
(especially, the certificate relied upon),
to establish the transaction in question,
and to establish the wider agreement that
defines the act.
</dd>

<dt>Wider Protocol</dt>
<dd>
In principle, reliance will be part of a wider protocol
(customary method in reaching and preserving agreement)
that presents and preserves sufficient of the evidence
for dispute resolution under CAcert's forum of Arbitration.
The protocol should be agreed amongst the parties,
and tuned to the needs.
This CPS does not define any such protocol.
In the absence of such a protocol, reliance will be weakened;
a dispute without sufficient evidence may be dismissed by an Arbitrator.
</dd>

<dt>As Compared to Usage</dt>
<dd>
Reliance goes beyond Usage.  The latter is limited to
letting the software act as the total and only Validation
Authority.  When relying, the Member also augments
the algorithmic processing of the software with her own
checks of the business, technical and certificate aspect.

<dt>Software Agent</dt>
<dd>
When relying on a certificate, relying parties should
note that your software is responsible for the way it
shows you the information in a certificate.
If your software agent hides parts of the information,
your sole remedy may be to choose another software agent.
</dd>

<dt>Malware</dt>
<dd>
When relying on a certificate, relying parties should
note that platforms that are vulnerable to viruses or
trojans or other weaknesses may not process any certificates
properly and may give deceptive or fraudulent results.
It is your responsibility to ensure you are using a platform
that is secured according to the needs of the application.

<h5>4.5.2.e When something goes wrong </h5>

In the event that an issue arises out of the Member's reliance,
her sole avenue is <strong>to file dispute under DRP</strong>.
See <a href="#p9.13">&sect;9.13</a>.
<!-- DRC_A&sect;A.4.d -->
For this purpose, the certificate (and other evidence) should be preserved.

<dl>

<dt>Which person?</dt>

Members may install certificates for other individuals or in servers,

remains the responsible person.
E.g., under Organisation Assurance, an organisation is issued
a certificate for the use by individuals
or servers within that organisation,
but the Organisation is the responsible person.

<section id="p5.8.1">
<h4>5.8.1 CA termination</h4>

<p>
In the event of operational termination, the
Roots (including SubRoots)
and all private Member information will be secured.
The Roots will be handed over to a responsible
party for the sole purpose of issuing revocations.
Member information will be securely destroyed.
</p>

<p>
The CA cannot be transferrred to another organisation.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p5.8.2">
<h4>5.8.2 RA termination</h4>

<p>
When an Assurer desires to voluntarily terminates
her responsibilities, she does this by filing a dispute,
and following the instructions of the Arbitrator.
</p>

<p>
In the case of involuntary termination, the process is
the same, save for some other party filing the dispute.

<h4>6.1.1. Key Pair Generation</h4>

<p>
Subscribers generate their own Key Pairs.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p6.1.2">
<h4>6.1.2. Subscriber Private key security</h4>

<p>
There is no technical stipulation on how Subscribers generate
and keep safe their private keys,
however, CCA 2.5 provides for general security obligations.
See <a href="#p9.6">&sect;9.6</a>.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p6.1.3">
<h4>6.1.3. Public Key Delivery to Certificate Issuer</h4>

<p>
Members login to their online account.
Public Keys are delivered by cut-and-pasting
them into the appropriate window.
Public Keys are delivered in signed-CSR form
for X.509 and in self-signed form for OpenPGP.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p6.1.4">
<h4>6.1.4. CA Public Key delivery to Relying Parties</h4>

<p>
The CA root certificates are distributed by these means:
</p>
<ul><li>
    Published on the website of CAcert,
    in both HTTP and HTTPS.
  </li><li>
    Included in Third-Party Software such as
    Browsers, Email-Clients.
    Such suppliers are subject to the Third Party Vendor Agreement.
</li></ul>
</section>

<section id="p6.1.5">
<h4>6.1.5. Key sizes</h4>

<p>
No limitation is placed on Subscriber key sizes.
</p>

<p>
CAcert X.509 root and intermediate keys are currently 4096 bits.
X.509 roots use RSA and sign with the SHA-1 message digest algorithm.
See <a href="#p4.3.1">&sect;4.3.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
OpenPGP Signing uses both RSA and DSA (1024 bits).
</p>

<p>
CAcert adds larger keys and hashes
in line with general cryptographic trends,
and as supported by major software suppliers.
</p>

<h4>6.1.6. Public key parameters generation and quality checking</h4>

<p>
No stipulation.

<section id="p6.1.7">
<h4>6.1.7. Key Usage Purposes</h4>

<p>
CAcert roots are general purpose.
Each root key may sign all of the general purposes
- client, server, code.
</p>

<p>
The website controls the usage purposes that may be signed.
This is effected by means of the 'template' system.

<h3>6.2. Private Key Protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering Controls</h3>

<section id="p6.2.1">
<h4>6.2.1. Cryptographic module standards and controls</h4>

<p>
SubRoot keys are stored on a single machine which acts
as a Cryptographic Module, or <em>signing server</em>.
It operates a single daemon for signing only.
The signing server has these security features:
</p>
<ul><li>
    It is connected only by one
    dedicated (serial USB) link
    to the online account server.
    It is not connected to the network,
    nor to any internal LAN (ethernet),
    nor to a console switch.
  </li><li>
    The protocol over the dedicated link is a custom, simple
    request protocol that only handles certificate signing requests.
  </li><li>
    The daemon is designed not to reveal the key.
  </li><li>
    The daemon incorporates a dead-man switch that monitors
    the one webserver machine that requests access.
  </li><li>
    The daemon shuts down if a bad request is detected.
  </li><li>
    The daemon resides on an encrypted partition.
  </li><li>
    The signing server can only be (re)started with direct
    systems administration access.
  </li><li>
    Physical Access to the signing server is under dual control.
</li></ul>

<p>
See <a href="#p5">&sect;5.</a> and the Security Policy 9.3.1.
</p>

<p>
(Hardware-based, commercial and standards-based cryptographic
modules have been tried and tested, and similar have been tested,
but have been found wanting, e.g., for short key lengths and
power restrictions.)

<h3>6.3. Other aspects of key pair management</h3>

<section id="p6.3.1">
<h4>6.3.1. Public key archival</h4>

<p>
Subscriber certificates, including public keys,
are stored in the database backing the online system.
They are not made available in a public- or subscriber-accessible
archive, see <a href="#p2">&sect;2</a>.
They are backed-up by CAcert's normal backup procedure,
but their availability is a subscriber responsibility.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p6.3.2">
<h4>6.3.2. Certificate operational periods and key pair usage periods</h4>

<p>
The operational period of a certificate and its key pair
depends on the Assurance status of the Member,
see <a href="#p1.4.5">&sect;1.4.5</a> and Assurance Policy (<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/AssurancePolicy.html">COD13</a>).
</p>

<p>
The CAcert (top-level) Root certificate
has a 30 year expiry.
SubRoots have 10 years, and are to be rolled over more quickly.
The keysize of the root certificates are chosen
in order to ensure an optimum security to CAcert
Members based on current recommendations from the
<a href="http://www.keylength.com/">cryptographic community</a>
and maximum limits in generally available software.
At time of writing this is 4096 bits.

<h2>8. COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<p>
There are two major threads of assessment:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Systems Audit</dt>
  <dd>
  Analyses the CA for business and operations security.
  This is conducted in two phases:  documents for compliance
  with criteria, and operations for compliance with documentation.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Code Audit</dt>
  <dd>
  Analyses the source code.
  This is conducted at two levels:
  Security concepts at the web applications level,
  and source code security and bugs review.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
See the Audit page at
<a href="https://wiki.cacert.org/Audit/">

for more information.
</p>

<section id="p8.1">
<h3>8.1. Frequency or circumstances of assessment</h3>
<p>
The first audits started in late 2005,
and since then, assessments have been an
ongoing task.
Even when completed, they are expected to
be permanent features.

<dl>

<dt>Systems Auditors</dt>
<dd>
CAcert uses business systems auditors with broad experience
across the full range of business, information systems
and security fields.
In selecting a business systems auditor, CAcert looks for
experience that includes but is not limited to
cryptography, PKI, governance, auditing,
compliance and regulatory environments,
business strategy, software engineering,
networks, law (including multijurisdictional issues),
identity systems, fraud, IT management.

<h3>8.3. Assessor's relationship to assessed entity</h3>

<p>
Specific internal restrictions on audit personnel:
</p>
<ul><li>
    Must be Assured by CAcert Assurers
    and must be background checked.
  </li><li>
    Must not have been active in any (other) role in CAcert.
    Specifically, must not be an Assurer, a member of the association,
    or in any other defined role or office.
  </li><li>
    Although the Auditor may be expected to undertake various
    of the activities (Assurance, Training)
    during the process of the audit, any results are frozen
    until resignation as auditor is effected.
  </li><li>
    The Auditor is required to declare to CAcert all
    potential conflicts of interest on an ongoing basis.
</li></ul>

<p>
Specific external restrictions on audit personnel:
</p>
<ul><li>
    Should have a verifiable and lengthy history in
    user privacy and user security.
  </li><li>
    Must not have worked for a competitive organisation.
  </li><li>
    Must not have worked for national security, intelligence,
    LEO or similar agencies.
</li></ul>

<p>
An Auditor may convene an audit team.
The same restrictions apply in general
to all members of the team, but may be varied.
Any deviations must be documented and approved
by the CAcert Inc. Board.
</p>
</section>

<section id="p8.4">
<h3>8.4. Topics covered by assessment</h3>

<p>
Systems Audits are generally conducted to criteria.
CAcert requires that the criteria are open:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Published</dt>
    <dd>
    The criteria must be reviewable by all interested parties.
    </dd>

    <dt>Understandable</dt>
    <dd>
    They should be understandable, in that they provide the
    sufficient information in a readable form for interested
    parties to follow the gist and importance.
    (Arcane security criteria may stretch this requirement.)
    </dd>

    <dt>Complete</dt>
    <dd>
    There must be sufficent background information that the
    whole story is there.  Especially, criteria that refer
    to undocumented practices or conventions deliberately
    kept secret must be avoided.
    </dd>

    <dt>Applicable</dt>
    <dd>
    The criteria should relate directly
    and unambiguously to a need of the identified interested parties
    (Members, Relying Parties, Subscribers, Assurers).
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
See
<a href="http://rossde.com/CA_review/">DRC</a>
for the current criteria.
If Auditor determines that a criteria fails to
follow the meet the above requirements, then the criteria
should be reworked to conform, or should be dropped
(both with explanatory notes).
</p>
</section>

<section id="p8.5">
<h3>8.5. Actions taken as a result of deficiency</h3>
<p>
See the current

for work completed, and
<a href="https://wiki.cacert.org/AuditToDo">Audit Todo list</a>
for work in progress.
</p>

<p>
Auditor may issue directives instructing changes,
where essential to audit success or other extreme
situations.
Directives should be grounded on criteria,
on established minimum or safe practices,
or clearly described logic.
Adequate discussion with Community
(e.g., CAcert Inc. Board and with Policy Group)
should precede any directive.
They should be presented to the same standard
as the criteria, above.

<h3>9.14. Governing law</h3>

<p>
The governing law is that of New South Wales, Australia.
Disputes are generally heard before the Arbitrator
under this law.
Exceptionally, the Arbitrator may elect to apply the
law of the parties and events, where in common,
but this is unlikely because it may create results
that are at odds with the Community.

<h3>9.15. Compliance with Applicable Law</h3>

<section id="p9.15.1">
<h4>9.15.1 Digital Signature Law</h4>
<p>
The Commonwealth and States of Australia have passed
various Electronic Transactions Acts that speak to
digital signatures.  In summary, these acts follow
the "technology neutral" model and permit but do not
regulate the use of digital signatures.
</p>

<p>
This especially means that the signatures created by
certificates issued by CAcert are not in and of themselves
legally binding human signatures, at least according to
the laws of Australia.
See <a href="#p1.4.3">&sect;1.4.3</a>.
However, certificates may play a part in larger signing
applications.  See <a href="#p1.4.1">&sect;1.4.1</a> for "digital signing" certificates.
These applications may impose significant
obligations, risks and liabilities on the parties.

<section id="p9.15.3">
<h4>9.15.3 Legal Process from External Forums</h4>

<p>
CAcert will provide information about
its Members only under legal subpoena or
equivalent process
from a court of competent jurisdiction.
Any requests made by legal subpoena are
treated as under the Dispute Resolution Policy
See
<a href="#p9.13">&sect;9.13</a>
and
<a href="https://www.cacert.org/policy/DisputeResolutionPolicy.html">COD7</a>.
That is, all requests are treated as disputes,
as only a duly empanelled Arbitrator has the
authorisation and authority to rule on the
such requests.
</p>

<p>
A subpoena should
include sufficient legal basis to support
an Arbitrator in ruling that information
be released pursuant to the filing,
including the names of claimants in any civil case
and an indication as to whether the claimants are
Members or not
(and are therefore subject to Dispute Resolution Policy).
