<h3 id="g0.0.1">Introduction </h3>

<!-- This section from A.1.a through A.1.c -->

<p>
The Configuration-Control Specification (CCS COD2) controls and tracks
those documents, processes and assets which are critical to the
business, security and governance of the CAcert operations.
</p>

<p>
This document is the procedure for CCS.
This document itself is a component of the CCS,
see §2.
<!-- A.1.c The configuration-control specification controls its own revision process. -->
All other documentation and process specified within
is derivative and is ruled by the CCS.
</p>

<p>
CCS is formated, inspired and designed to meet the needs of
David Ross Criteria -
<a href="http://rossde.com/CA_review/">Certificate Authority Review Checklist</a>
- section A.1 (DRC-A.1)
CCS may be seen as the index to systems audit under DRC.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.0.2">Documents  </h3>

<!-- A.1.c-h: The configuration-control specification controls the revision process for the CCS,CP,CPS,PP,SP,R/L/O  -->

<h4 id="g0.0.2.1">Controlled Document List  </h4>

<p>
This CCS creates a
Controlled Document List (CDL)
of Primary or "root" documents known as Policies.
Primary documents may authorise other secondary documents
into the CDL, or "practices" outside the list.
</p>

<p>
The Controlled Document List
contains numbers, locations and status
of all controlled documents.
The list is part of this CCS.
</p>

<!-- See A.1.k, logging of documents. -->

<h4 id="g0.0.2.2">Change  </h4>


<p>
Change to the documents
is as specified by
Policy on Policy (PoP).
Policy Officer is to manage the
<a href="https://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/Policies/ControlledDocumentList.html">CDL</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.0.2.3">Control  </h4>

<p>
CAcert policies are required to be owned / transferred to CAcert. See PoP 6.2.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.0.3">Hardware  </h3>

<!-- This section from A.1.j -->

<h4 id="g0.0.3.1">Controlled Hardware List  </h4>

<p>
Critical systems are defined by Security Policy.
</p>

<h4 id="g0.0.3.2">Change  </h4>

<p> See Security Policy.  </p>

<h4 id="g0.0.3.3">Control  </h4>

<p>
Security Policy places executive responsibility for Hardware with the Board of CAcert Inc.
Access is delegated to Access Engineers (SP 2) and Systems Administrators (SP 3).
Legal ownership may be delegated by agreement to other organisations (SP 9.4).
</p>

<h3 id="g0.0.4">Software  </h3>
<!-- A.1.i: The configuration-control specification controls changes to software involved in: certs; data; comms to public -->
<h4 id="g0.0.4.1">Controlled Software List  </h4>

<p>
Critical software is defined by Security Policy.
</p>

<!--

<ul class="q">

<li> Following are questions for exec + audit, not policy.

<li>One thing that is not so well covered by CAcert is the last bullet point of A.1.i</li>

<li>"communicating with subscribers and with the general public."</li>

<li>website is under SP;  maillists,blogs,etc are not.</li>

<li>as community has deliberately gone this direction, I suggest we argue it that way.</li>

<li> What is far more problematic is the failure to do CCA &amp; Challenge notification.</li>

<li> What about translingo and voting? </li>

<li> See <a href="https://lists.cacert.org/wws/arc/cacert-sysadm/2010-02/msg00008.html">thread</a> </li>
  </ul>
-->

<h4 id="g0.0.4.2">Change  </h4>

<p> See Security Policy.  </p>

<h4 id="g0.0.4.3">Control  </h4>

<p>
CAcert owns its code, or requires control over open source code in use
by means of an approved free and open licence.
Such code must be identified and managed by Software Assessment.
</p>

<p>
Developers transfer full rights to CAcert
(in a similar fashion to documents),
or organise their contributions under a
proper free and open source code regime,
as approved by Board.
Where code is published
(beyond scope of this document)
care must be taken not to infringe licence conditions.
For example, mingling issues with GPL.
</p>

<p>
The Software Assessment Team Leader
maintains a registry of assignments
of title or full licence,
and a registry of software under approved open source licences.
</p>
