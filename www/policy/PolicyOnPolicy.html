<h2 id="g0.1">0. Preliminaries </h2>
<p>
    Policy on Policy adopts the IETF model of

</p>

<p id="s1.2">
1.2
The policy covers itself.

For Audit purposes,
the policy is part of the Configuration-Control Specification
("CCS", <a href="http://rossde.com/CA_review/CA_review_A.html#A1">DRC_A.1</a>)
and also documents part of the CCS.
</p>

<p id="s1.3">

CAcert Inc., members under CAcert Community Agreement
(CCA =&gt; COD9) and other related parties under other agreements.
</p>

<p id="s1.4">

The Policy Officer manages all policies
and the policy group.

<i>DRAFT</i> and finalise in <i>POLICY</i> status.
