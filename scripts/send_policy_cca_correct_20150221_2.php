We have to inform you that there was an incorrect version of the CAcert Community Agreement (CCA) on the main website of CAcert for some a couple of days.

The CCA is the general terms and conditions for CAcert. We may only issue certificates and sign PGP keys to those who have accepted those conditions.

As you have accepted the CCA during that period, we want to give you a link to the correct version, to ensure that you are not confused about the different versions.

The correct version of the CCA can be found at:
http://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.html

Sincerely,
Eva StÃ¶we
CAcert Policy Officer
