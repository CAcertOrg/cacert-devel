<h3><?=_("Trusted Third Parties")?></h3>

<p><?=_("The Trusted Third Party (TTP) programme is intended to be used in areas without many CAcert Assurers.")?></p>

<p><?=_("A Trusted Third Party (TTP) is simply someone in your country that is responsible for witnessing signatures and ID documents. This role is covered by many different titles such as public notary, justice of the peace and so on.")?></p>

<p><?=_("With the TTP programme you can potentially gain assurance up to a maximum of 100 assurance points.")?></p>

<p><?=_("Currently CAcert has only developed the TTP programme to the level that you can gain 70 assurance points by TTP assurances.") ?></p>

<p><?=_("We are working to develop a process that will fill the gap of the missing 30 assurance points to allow you to get the maximum 100 assurance points.")?> </p>

<p><?=_("In the meanwhile you would need to close this gap with face to face assurances with CAcert Assurers. Think not only travelling to populated countries, but also remember that assurers may occasionally visit your country or area.")?></p>
