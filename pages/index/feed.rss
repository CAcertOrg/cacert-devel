			<title>Usage of integration branch</title>
			<description>
			  This is the <b>integration branch</b>. If it is not, please change this message in pages/index/feed.rss
			  
			  The integration branch is used as the base branch for the testserver. Ideally it should differ
			  from the release branch only in the explicit changes for the testserver (other icon and styles).
			  
			  For a test campaign you should create a new branch (something like "testserver-&lt;campaign name&gt;")
			  and merge in the bug-branches which are to be tested in the campaign. After the campaign is
			  finished the testserver should be reverted to the integration branch.
			  
			  If a patch is handed off to critical to be installed on the production system, the patch is
			  usually also merged into the release branch (so it continues to mirror the production system).
			  Then the patch should also be merged into the integration branch for the same reason.
